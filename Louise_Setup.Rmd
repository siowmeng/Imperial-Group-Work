```{r setup}
movies <- read.csv("movie_metadata.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
str(movies)
```

## Some initial plots

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(plyr)

counted <- count(movies, 'country')
removednas <- counted[complete.cases(counted),]
sorted <- arrange(removednas,desc(freq))
head <- sorted[1:10,]
head$country <- factor(head$country, levels = head$country[order(head$freq)])

ggplot(head, aes(x=country, y=freq, fill=country, label=freq)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip() + geom_text(size=3,nudge_y=150) + guides(fill=FALSE) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0,4100)) + ggtitle("Top 10 countries with multiple IMDB top 5000 movies") + labs(x = "", y="Frequency") 
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
