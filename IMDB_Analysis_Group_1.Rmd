#Executive Summary
*to be filled out after we have finished our analysis*

#Introduction

*Introduction to go here (person to fill out TBD)*
*key purpose/concepts that we are trying to explore are what makes a movie popular (based on the gross revenue), and what makes a movie highly rated by the public (based on the imdb score)*

#Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
movies <- read.csv(file = "movie_metadata.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE)
```

*Explanation of the data and how it was extracted from IMDB to go here - Steven L*

The dataset used in this report was downloaded from *kaggle.com*, a website for data analysis competitions. The data was scraped from three websites using *Scrapy*, a Python library. The first website, *the-numbers.com*, is a website providing movie industry data. This website was used to scrape 5000 movie names along relevant data such as budget and gross domestic revenue. No pattern could be identified as to how the movie names were chosen. It was therefore assumed that the data represents a random sample. The scraped movie names were then matched with *imdb.com*, a popular resource for movie and TV-show ratings, and celebrity content, in order to get movie scores, direct links to movie pages, and other relevant features. All the movie and actor names were later aggregated and used to extract the number of Facebook likes on their respective official Facebook page. Finally, a face detection algorithm was applied to all movie posters to extract the number of faces in each poster. The dataset contains `r dim(movies)[1]` movies with `r dim(movies)[2]` variables spanning 100 years and 66 countries of origin.    
   
Although *imdb.com* covers movies from various different countries, the website is only offered in English, which implies certain limitations. The movies included in the dataset are skewed towards an English-speaking audience. This means that movies from North America, the UK, and other English speaking countries are overrepresented. In addition, the dataset includes more movies with release dates after 1980. In fact, multiple release years prior to 1980 include as little as one movie. NA?  
   
Despite these limitations the dataset offers extensive information on movies as well as a large enough number of observations. This will allow the analysis to  reveal interesting insights and answer the report's leading question. The dataset can be retrieved [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset).

# create table
kable(movie_variables, format = "markdown")
```

*also to potentially include as discussed: explanation of each of the columns and what they mean (box office gross or total gross including dvd sales etc.? and budget as final budget or expected budget?*

# Data Cleansing

*As we agreed in the discussion - feel free to let me know if I made any mistakes - Louise to take the code from George/Stephen and add in the steps agreed below*

First we look into the amount of NA variables found in each column our data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## function to calculate list of NAs within a column
colNA <- function(dfCol){ sum(is.na(dfCol)) }
## To show table of sum of NAs by column
apply(movies, 2, colNA)
```

The following cleansing process is then applied:

* All rows where the title year is NA are removed - as there are a high number, and this variable is not expected to be key to the analysis.
* All rows where gross is NA are removed - as there are a high number, and this variable is expected to be one of the output variables
* All rows where the budget is NA are removed - as there are a high number, and this variable is expected to be key to the analysis.
* The aspect ratio column is removed - as there are a high number of NAs, and this variable is not expected to be key to the analysis. (*Louise comment - should we justify this somewhere?*)
* The IMDB link column is removed - as this variable is not expected to be key to the analysis

After this point there are only a few NAs remaining.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## To remove rows where NAs are present for any of the applicable columns
movies <- movies[complete.cases(movies[c("title_year","budget","gross")]),]
## To remove aspect ratio and imdb link columns
movies$aspect_ratio<- NULL
movies$movie_imdb_link<- NULL
## To show table of sum of NAs by column
apply(movies, 2, colNA)
```

* For all other columns where there are NAs, the mean value will be used to replace all NAs within that column. Although this has some drawbacks in terms of accuracy, it allows us to maintain rows of data with other valid information, and is an unbiased approach to handling NAs.
*Louise comment - I will find some literature on this and explain it better*
```{r, echo = FALSE}
## for loop to replace NAs with means for particular columns
for (i in c("actor_1_facebook_likes" , "actor_2_facebook_likes" , "actor_3_facebook_likes" , "num_critic_for_reviews" , "duration" , "facenumber_in_poster"))
 {k <- which(colnames(movies)==i)
 movies[k][is.na(movies[k]==TRUE)] <- round(mean(movies[[k]], na.rm=TRUE),0)}
```

* Unwanted strings "Â" as well as leading and trailing white spaces are removed from the "title" column.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
movies <- movies[!duplicated(movies$movie_title),]
# Function to remove Â, leading and trailing whitespace from movies$movie_title
movie_title_processing <- function(str){
  str <- sub(pattern = "Â", replacement = "", str)
  str <- sub(pattern = "^\\s+|\\s+$", replacement ="", str)
}
# Apply previous function
movies$movie_title <- sapply(movies$movie_title, FUN = movie_title_processing)
```

Although some of these steps reduce the sample size for analysis, the rows removed would either cause later analysis to fail, cause the dataset to be inconsistent across various pieces of analysis, or produce misleading results.

This cleansed dataset (of `r nrow(movies)` rows) contains no NA values and is used for the remainder of the analysis.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
apply(movies, 2, colNA)
```
*General note: I plan to tidy up the writing here later but just wanted to get down our discussion :)*

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
intrain <- createDataPartition(y = movies[[1]], p = 0.9, list = FALSE)
train <- movies[intrain, ]
test <- movies[-intrain, ]
```

10% of the cleansed dataset (`r nrow(test)`) is then set aside to be the "test" dataset, leaving the remaining 90%  of our dataset (`r nrow(movies)`) as the training dataset. The training dataset alone will be used for all descriptive, inferential and predictive analysis, including model building. The "test" dataset will be used at a later stage to check the accuracy of the predicted model.


# Descriptive Data Analysis

*For now, each have a section with one (or more) descriptive plot, later we can discuss how this flows into a narrative - we should let everyone in the slack group know what we're doing so that we don't overlap unecessarily**

*different options we discussed are:*

* *Map diagram with bubbles showing movies by country*
* *Time analysis - multiple boxplots for each decade (LF note: could also be under inference - if you then want to discuss whether decade is a good predictor of revenue - might get different results if you take decade as a number or a factor)*
* *imdb score against gross coloured by: actor/director/country*
* *frequency of movies with different genres/keywords - (George has already done this)*
* *Ratings broken down by genre (boxplot)*
* *Top actors in terms of facebook likes*
* *Analysis of top movies (by score and gross)*
* *Total number of facebook likes - histogram*

Descriptive analysis on the country

```{r}
# Sorting the movies by country and picking out the top 10
counted <- count(movies, 'country')
removednas <- counted[complete.cases(counted),]
sorted <- arrange(removednas, desc(freq))
topcountries <- sorted[1:10,]
topcountries$country <- factor(topcountries$country, levels = topcountries$country[order(topcountries$freq)])

# Taking the countries with more than 10 movies
countries <- subset(movies, country %in% c("Australia", "Canada", "China", "France", "Germany", "India", "Japan", "Spain", "UK", "USA"))

score <- countries$imdb_score
gross <- countries$gross

# Plot of gross revenue for the above countries

    labs(title = "Gross revenue of movies by country", x = "", y = "Gross revenue") +

    scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1e+02, 1e+04, 1e+06, 1e+08, 1e+10), 
                  labels = c("100", "10,000", "1 million", "100 millions", "1 billion"))

# Plot of imdb score for the above movies
ggplot(countries, aes(country, score, fill = country)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "IMDB Score of movies by country", x = "", y = "Gross revenue") + 
    theme_few() +
    theme(legend.position = "None") +
    theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

ggplot(countries, aes(x = score, y = gross, colour = country)) + 
  geom_jitter() + scale_x_log10()+ labs(title = "IMDB Score and Gross Revenue for different countries", x = "IMDB Score", y = "Gross Revenue") +
  facet_wrap(~ country) +
  theme_few() + 
  theme(legend.position = "None") + 
    scale_y_log10(breaks = c(1e+02, 1e+04, 1e+06, 1e+08, 1e+10), 
                  labels = c("100", "10,000", "1 million", "100 millions", "1 billion"))
```

More than 50% of US, UK and Germany releases are generating high revenues of over 10 million. On the other hand, more than 25% of releases in India, Japan and China respectively are generating revenues of lower than 1 million.

Looking at the IMDB scores, movies across all ten countries are getting IMDB scores above 6. In Indian & Japan, at least 40% of the movies got more than 7, whereas movies in Australia and USA have almost equal numbers scoring between 6 and 7.

Therefore, it can be deduced that revenue and IMDB scores are clearly independent of each other. This can be seen in the scatterplots - UK & US movies seem to be symmetrically about 'y = x'; however, the other countries show no particular relationship between the two variables.

### Cecilia

Descriptive analysis on the budget

1. Budget of movies

2. Budget of films in the top 13 countries (with 10 or more movies in the data set, the rest have been omitted)

```{r, echo = FALSE}

##Histogram for movie budget
ggplot(data=movies, aes(movies$budget)) + geom_histogram(fill="#FF9999", colour="black") + scale_x_log10() + labs(x = "Budget (USD)", y="Count", title = "Budget of Movies") 


##Country vs budget boxplot

#Find out which countries with over 10 movies in data set
subsetcountry <- count(movies, vars = "country") 
subsetcountry <- subsetcountry[order(subsetcountry[,2], decreasing = TRUE),] 
subsetcountry <- subsetcountry[subsetcountry[,2] >= 10,]
ggplot(data = subsetcountry) + geom_bar(aes(x = country, y = freq), stat="identity")

#Create dataframe with just Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, UK, USA

budgetcountry <- subset(movies, country %in% c("Australia", "Canada", "China", "France", "Germany", "Hong Kong", "India", "Italy", "Japan", "Mexico", "Spain", "UK", "USA"))

#box plot for countries vs budget

ggplot(data = budgetcountry) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = country, y = budget, fill = country)) + scale_y_log10() + labs(x = "Country", y="Budget (USD)") + ggtitle("Budget of films by country") + theme(legend.position="none")

```

From the plots, we can see that the average budget on the films across different countries is similar, around a ballpark range of 10 million to 100 million. India and Mexico appears to have a lower average for film budget than the rest of ther other countries.

### George

Will do an analysis on *Gross revenue* and *IMDB score* based on *Genres* and *Plot Keywords*. :)

##### Genres

Descriptive analysis based on the movies genres and how do they correlate possibly with other variables of the dataset. Genres with less than 10 movies have been omitted. The first graph shows the number of movies in each genre while the second and the third plots present a boxplot for each genre associated with the profit of the movies and the IMDB score of the movies respectively.

The plot above show that there might be a downward trend in IMDB scores over the years. Some years, however, include fewer than ten movies. To get a more accurate picture of the development of IMDB scores only years with ten or more entries will be plotted below.

##create summary statistics for average imdb score & number of movies for each director
directorssummary <- ddply(movies, ~ director_name,summarise,score_average=round(mean(imdb_score),2), gross_average=round(mean(gross),2), number_of_movies=length(director_name))
##sort by # of movies then imdb average score
sorteddirectorsummary <- arrange(directorssummary,desc(number_of_movies), desc(score_average))
##ensure that factors are in the order of number of movies, otherwise ggplot will default to alphabetical ordering in the graph
sorteddirectorsummary$director_name <- factor(sorteddirectorsummary$director_name, levels = sorteddirectorsummary$director_name[order(sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies)])
```

There are `r nrow(sorteddirectorsummary)` distinct directors in the data sample.The density of movies per director is as below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
##Histogram for number of moveies per director
ggplot(sorteddirectorsummary, aes(x=number_of_movies)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="darkblue") + labs(x = "Number of movies in sample") + ggtitle("Density of number of movies per director")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
##add a categorical variable for one movie or more
sorteddirectorsummary$more_than_one_movie <- rep.int(0, nrow(sorteddirectorsummary))
sorteddirectorsummary$more_than_one_movie[sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies>1] <- 1
##calculate the percentage of directors with exactly one movie
dirpercentage <- round(100*length(sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies[sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies==1])/length(sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies),2)
```

This is clearly positively skewed, with many directors having only 1 movie in the dataset, and only a few having significantly more. In fact, approximately  `r dirpercentage` of those directors have only 1 movie in the top 5000, leaving `r 100-dirpercentage` that have more than 1.

An initial look at the relationship between # of movies that the director has in the dataset, and gross revenue does not show a clearly defined correlation:

```{r echo=FALSE}
##add # of movies per director to the main dataset.
movieswithdirectordata <- merge(movies, sorteddirectorsummary, by="director_name")
movieswithdirectordata <- rename(movieswithdirectordata, c('number_of_movies'='dir_number_of_movies'))

  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.05) +
  labs(x = "Number of movies by director in sample", y = "Average Gross Revenue") + scale_y_continuous(label=human_usd)
```

To check against one potential confounder, we plot the # of movies per director against budget:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
##plot for budget vs number of directors in sample
ggplot(movieswithdirectordata, aes(x = dir_number_of_movies, y = budget)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.05) +
  labs(x = "Number of movies by director in sample", y = "Budget") + scale_y_continuous(label=human_usd)

cor.test(movieswithdirectordata$dir_number_of_movies, movieswithdirectordata$budget)
```

Even though this correlation is statistically significant, it is quite small (`r round(cor(movieswithdirectordata$dir_number_of_movies, movieswithdirectordata$budget),3)`%), so the analysis of movies by director sample on gross revenue can be continued without an obvious confounder of budget.

If we then split this out by decades, we can see the below:
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
##add the decades in as per Steven's code (note: potentially change into a function?)
movieswithdirectordata$decade <- sapply(movieswithdirectordata$title_year, FUN = convert_decade)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movieswithdirectordata, aes(x = dir_number_of_movies, y = gross, colour = decade)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + scale_y_continuous(label=human_usd) + labs(title = "Gross Revenue and # of director movies for different decades", x = "# of Movies by Director", y = "Gross Revenue") + facet_wrap(~ decade, ncol = 5) + theme(legend.position = "None") + geom_smooth(color="#000000")
```

As the number of data elements in the sample grows for each decade, a geomtrical pattern also seems to emerge, which is an upwards trend of gross revenue by movies per director up to about 10 movies per director, andthen a less clear trend for movies for movies with 10+ movies per director.

Similarly for genres:

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
movies_and_genres_withdirectordata <- merge(movies_and_genres, movieswithdirectordata[,c("movie_title","dir_number_of_movies")], by="movie_title")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
##requires the above
ggplot(movies_and_genres_withdirectordata, aes(x = dir_number_of_movies, y = gross, colour = genre)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) + scale_y_continuous(label=human_usd) + labs(title = "Gross Revenue and # of director movies for different genres", x = "# of Movies by Director", y = "Gross Revenue") + facet_wrap(~ genre) + theme(legend.position = "None") + geom_smooth(color="#000000")
```

Most of the genres also seem to approximately follow the pattern of a positive correlation up to 10 movies by director, and then a less predictable path for those with directors with higher numbers of movies.

```{r echo=FALSE}
##add a categorical variable for ten movies or more
sorteddirectorsummary$more_than_ten_movies <- rep("Fewer than 10", nrow(sorteddirectorsummary))
sorteddirectorsummary$more_than_ten_movies[sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies>10] <- "10+"
##calculate the percentage of directors with exactly one movie
morethantendirpercentage <- round(100*length(sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies[sorteddirectorsummary$more_than_ten_movies==1])/length(sorteddirectorsummary$number_of_movies),2)

movieswithdirectordata <- merge(movieswithdirectordata, sorteddirectorsummary[,c("director_name","more_than_ten_movies")], by="director_name")

movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies <- factor(movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies, levels=c("Fewer than 10", "10+"))

morethantenmovpercentage <- round(100*length(movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies[movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies==1])/length(movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies),2)

```

Only approximately `r morethantendirpercentage`% directors have more than ten movies, which, when considering movies, constitutes approximately `r morethantenmovpercentage`% of movies in our sample.

# Inferential Data Analysis

*For now, each have a section with one comparison and test/set of tests (t.test, var.test, cor.test etc.), it is expected this section will also include plots, later we can discuss how this flows into a narrative - we should let everyone in the slack group know what we're doing so that we don't overlap unecessarily*

*It is expected that these will be related to how inputs are correlated with the two outcome variables (gross and imdb_score)*

# boxplot of English & Non-English movies
temp <- movies

temp$english <- factor(temp$language == "English", levels = c(TRUE, FALSE), labels = c("English", "Non-English"))

ggplot(data = temp, aes(x = english, y = gross)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Gross Revenue of English and non-English Movies", x = "English or Non-English Movies", y = "Gross Revenue") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1e8))

t.test(movies$gross[movies$language == "English"], movies$gross[movies$language != "English"], alternative = "greater")

var.test(movies$gross[movies$language == "English"], movies$gross[movies$language != "English"], alternative = "greater")

```

From the above box-and-whisker plots, we can observe a great difference between the revenues achieved by English and non-English movies. More than 75% of the non-English movies achieved gross revenue of US$10 million or lower. In contrast, more than half of the English movies have more than US$25 million revenues.

In addition, the gross revenues of English movies vary greatly (compared to non-English movies).

We are confident to say that the English movies in this dataset are generally more popular than non-English movies.

t.test(movies$gross[movies$content_rating == "R"], movies$gross[movies$content_rating == "PG"])
```

PG, PG-13 and R are the most common ratings observed in our datatset. Looking the boxplots, there is no major difference in gross revenues or IMDB scores for the three categories. However, R movies tend to on average have higher IMDB scores and lower revenues than G or PG-13 rated movies. 

This is consistent with the t-test results. There is no difference in the mean scores for PG and PG-13 movies whereas p-values lower than 5% support the alternative hypothesis that the difference in mean scores for R and P/PG-13 movies is not equal to 0.

Does budget affect imdb score?

```{r}

#scatter plot for budget vs imdb score

ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(aes(x = budget, y = imdb_score, colour="#FF9999")) + labs(x = "Budget", y = "IMDB Score") + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million")) + theme(legend.position="none")

#covariance test

cov(movies$budget, movies$imdb_score)

#correlation test

cor.test(movies$budget, movies$imdb_score)

```

The covariance value of 5306036 suggests that there is an upward trend, as budget increases, imdb score increases. The Pearson's correlation test between budget and IMDB score gives us a p-value of 0.047, which suggests that there isn't a high correlation between budget of the movie and rating on IMDB. 

Even if we dig deeper to look at the effect of budget on IMDB score for movies from different countries, it appears to be that there is not much of a trend.


```{r}

ggplot(data = budgetcountry) + geom_jitter(aes(x = budget, y = imdb_score, color=country, alpha = 0.1)) + labs(x = "Budget", y = "IMDB Score") + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million"))


ggplot(budgetcountry, aes(x = budget, y = imdb_score, colour = country)) + 
  geom_jitter() + scale_x_log10()+ labs(title = "Budget and IMDB score for different countries", x = "Budget", y = "IMDB Score") + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million")) +
  facet_wrap(~ country) +
  theme_few() + 
  theme(legend.position = "None")

```


Does budget affect gross revenue of a movie?

```{r}

#scatter plot for budget vs gross

ggplot(data = movies) + geom_point(aes(x = budget, y = gross, colour="#FF9999")) + labs(x = "Budget", y = "Gross Revenue in USD") + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million")) + theme(legend.position="none")

#covariance test

cov(movies$budget, movies$gross)

#correlation test

cor.test(movies$budget, movies$gross)

```

The covariance value of 1.6 x 10^15 suggests that there is an upward trend, as budget increases, revenue from the movie increases. The Pearson's correlation test between budget and gross gives us a value of 0.22, which suggests that there isn't a high correlation between budget of the movie and gross, but slightly higher than the correlation between movie and imdb score.

If we subset the data by different countries, we still do not see a huge correlation between budget versus gross revenue.

```{r}

ggplot(data = budgetcountry) + geom_jitter(aes(x = budget, y = gross, color=country, alpha = 0.1)) + labs(x = "Budget", y = "Gross Revenue") + scale_x_log10() 


ggplot(budgetcountry, aes(x = budget, y = gross, colour = country)) + 
  geom_jitter() + scale_x_log10()+ labs(title = "Budget and Gross Revenue for different countries", x = "Budget", y = "Gross Revenue") + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million")) +
  facet_wrap(~ country) +
  theme_few() + 
  theme(legend.position = "None")

```


As both variables are indicators of a movie's popularity, we can conclude from the above analysis that budget does not have a huge influence on how 'popular' a movie is.



Does budget affect gross profit margin?

```{r}

#create grossprofit column
movieswprofit <- data.frame(movies)
movieswprofit$grossprofitmargin <- (movieswprofit$gross - movieswprofit$budget)/movieswprofit$gross * 100

#scatter plot for budget vs gross profit margin 
ggplot(data = movieswprofit) + geom_point(aes(x = budget, y = grossprofitmargin, colour = "#FF9999")) + scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1e+03, 1e+05, 1e+07, 1e+09), labels = c("1000", "100,000", "10 million", "1000 million")) + theme(legend.position="none") + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-1000, 100)) + theme(legend.position="none") + labs(x = "Budget in USD", y = "Gross Profit Margin as %")


#covariance test

cov(movieswprofit$budget, movieswprofit$grossprofitmargin, use = "complete.obs") 

#correlation test

cor.test(movieswprofit$budget, movieswprofit$grossprofitmargin, use = "complete.obs")

```

Finally, we would also like to look at the effect of gross vs on gross profit margin, whether the an increase in budget would make a better movie, and hence a higher gross profit margin. Gross profit margin can be used as an indictor of profitability of movie. Based on the data, it appears that there is a negative correlation (-0.31) between budget and profit. Although it is not very strong, it still suggests that an increase in budget has a slight negative impact on gross profit margin.

From the plot, we can see that a lot of movies are not profitable. Around half of the movies are profitable (count = 1988), half are not (count = 1801).

```{r, echo = FALSE}

movieswprofit$profitable <- ifelse(movieswprofit$grossprofitmargin >= 0, "yes", "no")

table(movieswprofit$profitable)
                               

```



### George

In case of nominal variables it doesn't make sense to talk about what happens if these variables increase/decrease, because they don't have a numerical value that can go up/down. So we can correlate neither "Genres" nor "Keywords" with "Gross Revenue" or "IMDB Score". However, there are measures of strength of association we can use that are somewhat analogous.

When we actually make predictions based on a linear model for categorical data, the predicted value is equal to the mean of all observations for each categorical value. So, for each genre or keyword, the predicted value of the gross revenue is equal to the mean value of gross revenues of all the movies of that genre or of that keyword, e.g. the predicted gross revenue for a "Drama" movie is equal to the mean of gross revenues of all the observed "Drama" movies.

### Louise

*Would potentially like to do some inference regarding directors*

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
##plot for gross revenue vs # of movies
ggplot(movieswithdirectordata, aes(x = dir_number_of_movies, y = gross)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.05) + geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Number of movies in sample", y = "Gross Revenue") + scale_y_continuous(label=human_usd)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
##plot for imdb rating vs # of movies
ggplot(movieswithdirectordata, aes(x = dir_number_of_movies, y = imdb_score)) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.05) + geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Number of movies in sample", y = "IMDB Score")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
##cor test for imdb rating vs # of movies
cor.test(movieswithdirectordata$imdb_score,movieswithdirectordata$dir_number_of_movies)
##does seem like very loosely positively correlated and is probably because of the correlation with budget- more analysis to come.
##cor test for gross score vs # of movies
cor.test(movieswithdirectordata$gross,movieswithdirectordata$dir_number_of_movies)
##does seem like somewhat positively correlated - although we can see from the graph that this doesn't seem linear.
```

These correlation tests do infer that there is a slight positive correlation between the two outcome variables (gross and imdb score) and the # of movies the director has in the sample. However, the impact on gross revenue does not look to be linear, and neither of the correlations seem to be particularly strong. Whether or not a director is prolific does not seem to have a strong impact on the quality (as proxied by imdb score) or popularity (as proxied by gross revenue) of a movie.

If we look at the categorical variable of whether or not a director has directed >10 movies, then we can see these distributions look slightly different:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movieswithdirectordata, aes(x=1, y = gross, fill = more_than_ten_movies)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(. ~ more_than_ten_movies) + labs(x="", title="Gross revenue distribution by \n number of movies per director") + scale_y_continuous(label=human_num) + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        legend.position = "None") 
```

The plots seem to suggest that the movies where the director has 10+ movies in the sample have a higher mean and a lower variance of gross revenue. However, this may be largely explained by the number of observations in each sample. To determine whether the change is statistically significant we run a t test and an f test.

```{r echo = FALSE}
t.test(movieswithdirectordata$gross[movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies=="10+"], movieswithdirectordata$gross[movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies=="Fewer than 10"], alternative="greater")

var.test(movieswithdirectordata$gross[movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies=="10+"], movieswithdirectordata$gross[movieswithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies=="Fewer than 10"], alternative="greater")
```

The data therefore suggests that the average gross revenue is higher for movies where the director has over 10 movies in the sample - which gives evidence to the claim that prolific directors are produce more popular movies (if we see gross revenue as a proxy for popularity).

Also, the opposite of the initial intuition appears to be the case for variance, the movies made by directors with over 10 movies in the sample has higher variance than others. This can be explained by the much larger number of movies made by directors with fewer than 10 movies.

##Predictive Model - Louise

```{r echo=FALSE}
traindirectorsummary <- ddply(train, ~ director_name,summarise, number_of_movies=length(director_name))
##add a categorical variable for ten movies or more
traindirectorsummary$more_than_ten_movies <- rep("Fewer than 10", nrow(traindirectorsummary))
traindirectorsummary$more_than_ten_movies[traindirectorsummary$number_of_movies>10] <- "10+"
trainwithdirectordata <- merge(train, traindirectorsummary[,c("director_name","more_than_ten_movies")], by="director_name")
##set factors so that Fewer than Ten is the default variable, and 10+ will show in the model
trainwithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies <- factor(trainwithdirectordata$more_than_ten_movies, levels=c("Fewer than 10", "10+"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
directormodel <- lm(gross ~ more_than_ten_movies + budget + imdb_score + num_voted_users + content_rating + duration + cast_total_facebook_likes + director_facebook_likes + movie_facebook_likes, data=trainwithdirectordata)
summary(directormodel)
```

###Justification
###Variables included in the model:
* Inferential analysis showed that whether or not the director has more than ten movies in the sample is correlated with the mean of gross revenue, so this is included as a dependent variable.
* Inferential analysis also showed that the budget of a movie is positively correlated with the gross revenue, which can be interpreted as movie-makers being wise enough to get a high return on investment.
* IMDB score can be seen as the "quality" of a movie, as voted on by the public. At first look this variable is positively correlated with the gross revenue, but interestingly the coefficient for this variable is negative once the "number of user reviews" variable is included. An interpretation of this is that the popularity of a movie is more fully explained by the number of people reviewing the movie, and after this is taken into account, the movies with a higher "quality", as measured by imdb score, actually do less well in the box office. This could be because people are more likely to go and vote on imdb for movies they liked, and also for the obvious reason that people are more likely to go and vote on imdb for movies they have seen, so number of user reviews will be linked to number of cinema tickets sold, which is linked to gross revenue.
* Inferential analysis also showed that for a few of the key ratings (G, PG and PG-13) there was some impact on gross revenue, so rating has been included in the model.
* The duration, when included into the model has a statistically significant positive coefficient, this could be interpreted as movie-goers perceiving longer movies as more value for money or higher quality.
* Cast total facebook likes can also be seen as a potential predictor for gross revenue, as in theory the more popular the actor (measured by facebook likes), the more people will go to see the movie to see that actor, the more tickets are sold and therefore the higher the revenue. We can see from the positive coefficient that this seems to be reflected in the data.
* Director facebook likes is statistically significant when included into the model, interestingly with a negative coefficient. Again, this variable is at first glance positively correlated with the gross revenue, however once you take into account the number of voted users, this relationship is reversed, potentially for similar reasons to the above.
* Movie facebook likes is also statistically significant when included into the model, this can be interpreted as a proxy for the popularity of the movie, and also could be that the more people who saw the movie (based on gross revenue), the more people then subsequently liked the page.

###Not included into the model
* Movie title, director name, genres, plot keywords, and actor names were not included into the variable as there many different values for these variables with a small number of observations (usually one observation) for each.
* Number of critic reviews is quite highly correlated with the number of user reviews, with a correlation coefficient of (`r round(cor(movies$num_user_for_reviews,movies$num_critic_for_reviews),2)). So it was decided to include only one of these variable into the model, in this case number of user reviews.
* When decade is included then none are found to be statistically significant, after other variables are included.
* When color is included into the model then none of the options are found to be statistically significant, there is also not a very large variation in this variable in the sample set.
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=color)) + geom_bar() + xlab("")
```
* When either language or country are included into the model, the R squared does go up, but by less than 0.01, and this also includes a lot of additional values to be interpreted, so the model loses some interpretability. Due to this, these factors have been left out. 
* The multpiple actor "facebook likes" variables are mostly correlated with each other, as can be seen from the correlation matrix, so the total cast facebook likes has been chosen as the "overall" variable to explain the effects of facebook popularity of the cast.
* The number of faces in the poster has not been included into the model, when included it is only slightly statistically significant, and the intuition behind this variable is unclear, so including it may lead to model overfitting.

This model has This model has much lower predictive power (adjusted R squared of `r summary(directormodel)$adj.r.squared`), R squared on the training set.

##Second Model, with only pre-known variables

```{r echo=FALSE}
directormodelknownvariables <- lm(gross ~ more_than_ten_movies + budget + content_rating + duration + cast_total_facebook_likes + director_facebook_likes + movie_facebook_likes, data=trainwithdirectordata)
summary(directormodelknownvariables)
```

To build a model to predict revenue of movies that have not yet been released, we include only variables that are known before the time of release. Our dataset provided us with number of facebook likes at a specific point in time, and to use this as part of our predictive model we would need to analyse number of facebook likes before the movie was released, however we will use what we currently have as a proxy to build the model. This model has much lower predictive power (adjusted R squared of `r summary(directormodelknownvariables)$adj.r.squared`), but could be used in a more usefull business context.


# Predictive Data Analysis

###Model Building and Justification
*we will all make two predictive models, one for "gross" and one for "imdb_score", using whatever inputs we can get from our dataset, at a later stage we'll compare them and see whose has the lowest mean squared error (which we can also justify) - and include that into this section*

*We discussed potentially including a new variable into the model, or to build a dual model that has different inputs for movies before 2010, and after 2010, which is the cutover point at which facebook likes for a movie became a meaningful indicator*

#To be removed- Notes and comments:

At the end of the assignment we should go back to:

* Check coding standards are consistent (and align with his recommendation - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
* Check language is consistent (tense / case)
* Convert ggplots into the same theme - colour scheme, fonts, etc.
* All assumptions have been noted in the appropriate sections
* We think we're roughly aiming for 20ish pages - tbd at a later stage
* Make sure we don't use language that implies causation when we can only infer correlation
* Double check each others' analyses for Simpson's paradox.
* Maybe put all libraries at the top?
